# Color Palette: Pattern Recognition and Classification of Images 

The primary goal of this thesis is to allow the user to query a database of color palettes, as extracted
by VIAN, based on color names, user defined color palettes, as well as by color contrasts. The
development and implementation will be carried out in close contact with film scholars actively working in the
realm of film color.
